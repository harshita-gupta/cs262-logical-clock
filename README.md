## How the model was built 
We began by writing a Machine() class, which would act as the virtual machine/clock. Before beginning, we considered a few things--such as how the machines would communicate with each other, whether we would need to use sockets, etc. We decided to bypass sockets by using Python's multiprocessing package. By using the Queue() class from this library, we were able to create message queues that could be accessed, altered, and shared simultaneously across all the different processes of virtual machines being run. We ensured that the virtual machines were indeed being run in parallel by using Python's multiprocessing Process
